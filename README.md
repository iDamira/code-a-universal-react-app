# [Code a Universal React App][published url]
## Instructor: [Jeremy McPeak][instructor url]


Coding a full-stack app has always been hard. Developers have to know client-side languages, tools, libraries, and frameworks, as well as a different set of server-side languages, tools, libraries, and frameworks! But with React and Node, we can finally use the same JavaScript code on both the client and server.

In this course, Envato Tuts+ instructor Jeremy McPeak will show you how write a universal (isomorphic) React appâ€”one that can render on the server or the client. This will let us reuse the same code on the server and client, and it will make it easier for search engines to index our app. Follow along as Jeremy builds a simple app in React with React Router, then upgrades it with server-side routing.
